# FPS Designer

FPS Designer is a project developed by two students for their first year project at EPITA (Paris, France).

FPS Designer is aimed to ease the creation of a First Person Shooter to people with no technical knowledge.
This Unity-like game creation tool includes a game rendering engine and a software to create stunning video games in the easiest way possible.


Dependencies
------------

- XNA 4.5 "Refresh"
- You need Visual Studio 2012 to open the solution.

Disclaimer
------------
This project is not maintained anymore and is using obsolete versions of a lot of dependencies.
As a requirement for our first year project, we had to use XNA, a framework which is no longer actively being developed.
